Subpage
=======

Copyright 2015 The Open University


Thes subpage module allows users to create, manage, and view lists of Moodle
activities separately from the main course page


Warning:

We support the subpage module in Moodle 2.8 but it is likely that this module
will be discontinued in a future version. However that might be some way off -
we are likely to continue to support it through Moodle 3.0 and possibly beyond.

Limitations:

The subpage module does not require any core changes. However, if you use it
without making core changes you will find that you are constantly redirected
back to the course page when you expected to be on the subpage.

If you would like a patch that you can apply - at your own risk, of course,
as is this whole thing, see the README file for one of the branches (however
we haven't provided a current patch, sorry).

Also please note that if you put something on a subpage it will seem natural
for the subpage to be included in the breadcrumbs, but it is not. We have
implemented code to address this as part of our theme; doing this properly
would require a significant core change which we haven't implemented yet.

Support:

We cannot offer direct support. Please do not contact me directly.
